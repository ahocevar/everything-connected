# everything-connected

This is a very simple demo of map applications connected through web sockets.

This is based on the [Getting Started](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) guide
of the Socket.IO website and uses its chat-example repository (https://github.com/socketio/chat-example) as starting point.

To start the demo:

    git clone https://github.com/ahocevar/everything-connected
    cd everything-connected
    npm install
    npm start

Then navigate to http://localhost:3000/
